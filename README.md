# nCHIP-8
A CHIP-8/SCHIP interpreter, written in C++17 with the use of SDL2 and Dear ImGui for UI. It's customizable and has debug capabilities!

Written just for fun.

## Features
- Full SCHIP support
- Sound support (Waveforms: sine, square and saw)
    - Changeable frequency and dB level
- Display colors are in RGB and they can be changed
- Two keypad mappings: the original COSMAC VIP and the modern one (which is used by most other interpreters)
- You can set custom CPU frequency value
- You can change the RANDOM seed (useful for debugging)
- If some games don't have mood to function properly, you can try to make them feel better by touching these quirks:
    - `BNNN`: use V0 as the offset
    - `DXYN`: horizontal wrapping
    - `DXYN`: vertical wrapping
    - `8XY6` & `8XYE`: set VX to VY
    - `8XY1`, `8XY2` and `8XY3`: reset VF
    - `FX55` & `FX65`: increment the I register
    - `DXY0`: draw 8x16 sprite in lo-res mode
- Debug capabilities:
    - Disassembler
    - Set, edit and remove breakpoints (they can also be named)
    - View stack
    - View and modify registers
    - Instruction executor
    - Keypad, in which buttons are held until they are released by second click (useful in the STEP mode)

## Building
You can build simply by creating `build` directory, going to it and calling the cmake (e.g. `cmake ..`)

Optionally, you can install nchip8 by typing `sudo cmake --install .`

## Usage
Just type `./nchip8` (or `nchip8` if you've installed it)!

For certain games you may like to change the amount of cycles per second, colors, etc.

## Todo
- ~~Ability to optionally disable flickering~~
- [x] Add pixel fading to smooth out the flickering
- [x] Support for SCHIP
- [ ] Support for XO-CHIP
- [ ] More debug features
    - [ ] Watch window
    - [ ] Memory view (and editor)
    - [ ] Logger
    - [ ] Add more controls to the existing tools
- [ ] CLI options
- [ ] Some kind of library that has a list of games, and for each game one can specify quirks and other options.
